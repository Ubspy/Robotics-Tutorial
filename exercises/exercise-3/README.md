# Exercise 1
This exercise will be short, but it's mostly for more practice on what you already know, and getting a little more used to strings. The goal of this exercise is to take in a word, and determine if it's a palindrome or not. For those of you who don't know what a palindrome is, it's a word (or string, but we'll stick to words to avoid those pesky spaces) where they read the same when reversed. Some examples are below:
* racecar
* tacocat
* pop
* bruhurb

As before, please only use the information I provide in the repository to help you, there are plenty of palindrome algorithms out there but looking those up won't help you learn.

Don't forget the properties of strings we learned: you can get the length of a string, and you can get the value of any character in a string

## Examples
Your output doesn't need to look exactly like mine, but it should be somewhat similar:
```
Please enter a word: tacocat
That is a palindrome
```

```
Please enter a word: racecar
That is a palindrome
```

```
Please enter a word: tacodog
That is not a palindrome
```
