	<summary>I don't know how to track which is smallest and biggest</summary>

	This is similar to what we did in the last exercise with the isPalindrome variable. You want to store a word that is the biggest, and set it along the way to what the biggest word is as you're looping through. An idea it so set that word to the first word in the array, then compare it to each i-th index of the array. You can do the oppposite for the smallest one.
