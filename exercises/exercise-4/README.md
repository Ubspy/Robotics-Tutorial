# Exercise 4
Your goal with this exercise will be to allow the user to enter any amount of words of their choise, and then you are to find both the shortest, and the longest word.

As before, please only use the information I provide in the repository to help you, there are plenty of palindrome algorithms out there but looking those up won't help you learn.

## Rules
* You must use an array

## Examples
Your output doesn't need to look exactly like mine, but it should be somewhat similar:
```
How many strings would you like to enter? 5
Enter string #1: dog
Enter string #2: cucumber
Enter string #3: octopus
Enter string #4: nergigante
Enter string #5: cactus
Your longest word was: nergigante
Your shortest word was: dog
```
