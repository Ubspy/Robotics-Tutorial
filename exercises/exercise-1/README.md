# Exercise 1
Your goal with this exercise is to create a program that takes two numbers, and gives an output. The example I would specifically like you to use is to take in the base and height for a triangle, and print back out to the user what the area of the triangle is.

Since this is the first exercise, I'll explain about how this all works. Ideally whoever is teaching you at this time will help verify that your program works correctly, and can help you along the way with any problems or questions you encounter. In the worst-case scenario though, I will provide hints and a solution for each exercise.

As for integrity while learning, I did say that while coding it's perfectly ok to google, but I'd like you to only use the information found in this repository, since a lot of these can be googled and boom you find the whole answer. You're not being graded or anything, so try to actually understand how the program works instead of finding a solution. Especially because I'll provide solutions for you.

The hints will start off with vague hints trying to guide you in the right direction, to more specific hints helping you with the problem at hand.

Usually the exercises will have a longer description, but this one is fairly simple, so I'll leave it after a few examples.

## Examples
Your output doesn't need to look exactly like mine, but it should be somewhat similar:
```
Please enter the base of your triangle: 12
Please enter the height of your triangle: 14
84.0
```

```
Please enter the base of your triangle: 2
Please enter the height of your triangle: 15
15.0
```

```
Please enter the base of your triangle: 5
Please enter the height of your triangle: 9
22.5
```

```
Please enter the base of your triangle: 3.25
Please enter the height of your triangle: 7.4
12.025
```
